Hi, juniors! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **PKK Jehovah Yii Zui Hon**, NV/8708636, but you can call me **Sir Hovah**.

I've noticed that many of you might be feeling a bit unsure about your knowledge in Palapes Laut. It's not just on your shoulders â€“ we, as seniors, also recognize our role in not sharing enough information with you.

That's why I've created this website â€“ to provide a solid starting point for you to delve into the basics of Palapes Laut. As the saying goes, "Junior's weakness is senior's fault." Let's work together to bridge that gap and empower you with the knowledge you need.

I hope this platform becomes a valuable resource for your learning journey. Whether it's understanding essential concepts or getting insights into Palapes Laut activities, this website aims to be your go-to place.

Remember, learning is a collective effort. If you come across anything you'd like to share or if you want to contribute to this knowledge hub, feel free to reach out to me personally [here](https://wa.me/601110501375). 

Additionally, you can create issues or suggest improvements on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hovahyii/Palapes-Laut-Notes/issues). Your feedback and contributions are essential to making this platform even better.

Wishing you a fantastic learning experience and success in your Palapes Laut journey!

Best regards,  
Hovah
